This script creates input sequences to a deep CNN model for C-Mapss Turbofan data. While the original dataset is usually processed with a sliding time window approach of size 30 and stride of 1, this script changes the "window" to a max time series of 362. Shorter sequences get 0-padded. Masks layers ensure that padding is not used for updating weights. Finally, a 0-1-matrix incorporates "event histories" of turbofan failures in 362 time steps. The network is supposed to learn to predict this matrix or, later on, the hazard rate function (as in survival analysis) instead of predicting RUL directly.
